            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CHRISTIANS WARFARE.</head>
            <p>THe whole life of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is a continued Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or Open War; his grand Antagoniſt is the Devil, that great <hi>Abbad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> the profeſſed Enemy and Deſtroyer; <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.11. whoſe grand deſign is to enlarge the terrotories of his deſtructive Kingdom, by the ſpoil and ruin of poor ſouls. This is evident from <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.1. where we have an account of his tyrannical aſſaulting of <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice:</hi> No ſooner is <hi>Adam</hi> ſettled in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice,</hi> in that glorious ſtate wherein God ſet him, but this implacable enemy aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults him; and alas! prevails. Now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got ſuch an intereſt by the Foil and Fall of poor <hi>Adam,</hi> he continues his ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, as we find manifeſted all along in the Scripture. He carries on his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in the Old World, in the inceſtuous <hi>Sodom;</hi> by <hi>Pharaoh</hi> towards the Children
<pb facs="tcp:35219:8"/>of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> nay even by the Patriarks, <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> as far as he can: and thus he aſſaults and prevails in a great meaſure. Nay no wonder if he aſſaults theſe poor Creatures, when he attempts to ſet upon Chriſt himſelf. Having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed ſo againſt the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> he'll ſee what he can do to the ſecond; but bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God, <hi>The Seed of the Woman has bruiſed the Serpents Head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we ſee how this <hi>Roaring Lyon goes about ſeeking whom he may devour;</hi> what Souls he can enſnare and entrap: He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virons and ſurrounds the Earth, to the intent he may devour.</p>
            <p>Moreover, He has two Attendants, <hi>(viz.)</hi> 1. The <hi>World.</hi> 2. The <hi>Fleſh;</hi> to carry on his helliſh deſigns and plots a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt poor Saints; and the deſtruction of every Chriſtian that endeavours to build up the Kingdom of Chriſt. And firſt he makes uſe of the World, that is, 1. The World it ſelf, the love whereof chokes that vigor and livelineſs that is or ought to be in a Chriſtian. 2. Wicked Men in the World, in whom he acts and ſoments all the venom he can, both for the hindrance of the Goſpels propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the deſtruction of thoſe that ſeek to be enlightened by it; to bring them to
<pb facs="tcp:35219:8"/>the true knowledge of God and his way. Diſmal is it to think, how far he hath, and at this very day doth, prevail by them. But bleſſed be <hi>God that hath ſet his King upon his Holy Hill of</hi> Sion; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.6.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Our inbred Corruptions, that is that, that is called the Fleſh; out of which proceeds an innumerable multitud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

According to our conſtitutions and natural inclinations, 2. To our conditions. Firſt, To our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, If they be inclining to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, he tempts to Deſpair, if to San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine, he tempts to Anger: If our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions be Chearful, he tempts to Laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſneſs: And ſo look what our Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Natural Inclinations are, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly he ſuits his Baits and Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Secondly, To our Conditions, If a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Nay, in a word, No Time, Place, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, Age, Conſtitution, Condition, wherein, and againſt, and according to whom, he doth not ſuit his poiſonous baits, and exerciſeth his utmoſt policy, and endeavours to ruin poor Souls.</p>
            <p>Bleſſed be God that he hath not left us ignorant of his Devices; but thrice bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be his Name that he has not left us Naked, but has left us his own Armory; <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. and that of proof, which is able to defend us from all the ſiery darts of this ſo potent an enemy. The parts whereof are, 1. The Helmet of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 2. The Breaſt-plate of Righteouſneſs. 3. The Shield of Faith. 4. The Girdle of Truth. 5. The Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word. 6. The Shoes of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the Goſpel of Peace. 7. And laſtly, The Engine of Prayer.</p>
            <p>Now let us ſee of what uſe all the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:35219:9"/>which, a Chriſtian would utterly deſpond. This is that that made ſo many Martyrs endure the moſt exquiſite Torments from the hands of Bloody Tyrants; <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Breaſt-plate of Righteouſneſs.</hi> This is walking in Holineſs and Blameleſneſs; this is that Proof-piece that bears a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian out, and keeps off all the falſe Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Slanders, that the Devil and Wicked Men (his Agents) can forge or invent againſt a Chriſtian.</p>

               </gap>oil'd this Champion; he oppos'd him with a <hi>Scriptum eſt,</hi> It is written.</p>

               </gap> Chriſt; according to that Holy Doctrine held forth in the Goſpel. He
<pb facs="tcp:35219:10"/>that is ſhod with theſe Shoes, is ſit for his Journey to <hi>Canaan,</hi> thorow all his Oppugnants; knowing that God who is at peace with him, is both able and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be his conduct and deliverer from them all.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Prayer.</hi> This is that brings ſucceſs to, and a bleſſing upon, all the reſt; and enables a Chriſtian, through Gods Free Grace and Mercy, to make uſe of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the pieces of the Armory.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee how Chriſt our Captain has fortified us; he has not left us to fight without Weapons, without Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and that of Proof; nay, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has led the Van: he underwent all the hardſhip in this <hi>Warfare,</hi> and has as it were, given the Devil his deaths wound: He has conquer'd Hell alſo and the Grave; he's the Triumphant King and Captain: He has unſtinged Death, he has only left us ſome ſmall work to do, and that he has promiſed to help us in.

            <pb facs="tcp:35219:10"/>
            <p>But it may be thoul't ſay, Thou canſt not tell whether Chriſt will be willing to accept thee for his Soldier or not?</p>
            <p>Willing, yes, if thou art willing; but 'tis rather to be feared thou art not willing, becauſe thou makeſt this objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: If he were not willing, to what end would he call and invite thee? O Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian do not doubt, but come; make no delay. Go to this Magazine, and inveſt thy ſelf herewith, and thy Captain will maintain thee; if thou art willing, though thou art weak, he'll fight for thee; only take notice, that if ever thou look back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, thou art but a dead man. Preſs forward towards the Mark, for thou haſt no Armour to defend thy back-parts. O Chriſtian be valiant, and take notice of this, that if thou reſiſt the Devil he is not able to with-ſtand thee, he'll flee from thee. Be upon thy watch, for thy ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is ſubtil, and will watch his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, if thou keep'ſt not ſtrict watch. Be much in the exerciſe of thy Weapons. eſpecially the Sword of the Spirit <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Word, and learn to imitate thy Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; he repels Sathans blows with a <hi>Scriptum eſt,</hi> It's written. O Chriſtian, quit thy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:35219:11"/>leaſt by diſuſe and diſaccuſtom'dneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, thou be to ſeek when thou ſhouldſt be upon thy Guard. Let nothing offend thee, neither Proſperity nor Adverſity, Strength nor Weakneſs: Let not Inſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity prevail over thee. He that hath ſent thy Captain, and given him, how ſhall he not with him freely give thee all things? O bleſſed King and Captain, that hath left poor Chriſtians ſuch a Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, ſuch a Magazine! O Chriſtian, ſet upon thy <hi>Warfare;</hi> make uſe much of that powerful Javelin <hi>Prayer.</hi> Get the art of caſting it, that in caſe at any time thou ſtandeſt in need and be in a ſtrait, thou mayſt make uſe of the ſame. And let me caution thee againſt two things, that thou be not too ſecure in time of thy Peace and Proſperity, nor too much careful in time of Trouble and Adverſity. And now for thy Proſperity and Succeſs, thou need'ſt not be afraid, for thy King and Captain will be all in all to thee and for thee. So ſight on.</p>

            <p>THough 'tis true that never any Man was or can be ſaved by the Merits of his own Righteouſneſs or Holineſs; yet 'tis as great and as infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible a truth, that never any was or can be ſaved without Holineſs.

If thou wouldſt not, ſhut and lay by, for I do not deſire to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate thy Torments; for know that the Word read or preached, will be the ſavor of Life unto Life, or the ſavor of Death unto Death.

            </p>
            <p>Anſwer, Of the many Reaſons, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Arguments, that might be drawn from both Sacred and Prophane Writings, I ſhall prefix only two, with ſome Scriptures:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt is, Becauſe otherwiſe there is no appearing before God, it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eing the ordinary way God has appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Follow Peace with all Men, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ee the Lord.</hi> Without Holineſs there can undoubtedly) be no Happineſs; without
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35219:14"/>Piety, there can be no Purity; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Purity no coming to God; for God is one that can behold no unclean thing; and without coming to God nothing but miſery. Moreover, he loſeth all the advantages in reſpect of this life, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, that honour that God doth dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie his people with. It is <hi>Moſes</hi>'s great Title, God gives him <hi>(viz.) My Servant.</hi> It is in Scripture accounted by the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt <hi>John,</hi> an honour to bear Chriſt's Shooes, much more an honour <hi>to ſuffer for Chriſt: They that honour me I will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi> 2. The comforts of this life, the pleaſures and delights that otherwiſe he might enjoy; I mean not outward but inward pleaſures and comforts, which are the true. Nay, in a word, <hi>Godlineſs is profitable for all things, having the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of this life, and that which is to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. So long as a man remains going on in a way of impiety, and unholineſs, he is not only kept from the beholding of God's face or countenance in any of God's Ordinances; but alſo he doth more and more every day incur God's wrath, diſpleaſure, and anger againſt him; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.11. God is angry with the wicked every day. Nay, further, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35219:15"/>himſelf more, and confirms him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a Servant of the Devil; and ſo inſtead of liſting himſelf under the Banner of Chriſt, he liſts himſelf under the Banner of Satan, and conſequently becomes <hi>Col.</hi> 1.21. the enemy of God and his ways; and not only an enemy, but enmity it ſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. and can a man or woman be ſuppoſed to be in a good condition, whilſt at variance with God; who is but as chaff before the wind, and as ſtubble before the fire.</p>
            <p>As I ſaid before, many Reaſons and Arguments to prove the neceſſity of an holy Life, might be drawn from Sacred and Prophane Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and Arguments, even from a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Morality or humane Reaſon; but ſeeing it is not our deſign at this time to produce them, ſince ſo many <hi>Worthies</hi> have ſo palpably demonſtrated, and proved it with invinceable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, even as a Cloud of Witneſſes; we ſhall only note ſome few Scriptures, which will ſtop the mouths of the moſt bloody <hi>Noro</hi>'s, tyrannizing <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s, ſubtle <hi>Ahitophel</hi>'s, and perſecuting <hi>Saul</hi>'s, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14 fore-cited, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 93.5. <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs becomes thine houſe for ever. Rom.</hi> 6.19, 22. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.13. and 4.13.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35219:15"/>
               <hi>Lev.</hi> 5.15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But indeed the beſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to an holy Life, is the conſideration of the effects of Death, of which in its place.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing that I ſhall do, ſhall be to give ſome few Directions in order to an holy Life, whereby to get a better and nearer intimacy with God, and to ingage the Heart more to love God, and God more to love again; or rather indeed God to love firſt, and then the heart to love again; for God muſt firſt love, or elſe we cannot love him; God muſt firſt work, both to will and to do, of his own good pleaſure.</p>
            <p>After acquaintance with God, to keep up holy communion with him; the firſt and beſt way will be to improve this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, as much as in us hes; for ſure I am, that though a man have attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a competent knowledge of the things of God, and hath found ſome Beams of God's radient love breaking out and breathing upon his Soul; if not improved, will not only damp the heart, and make it cold; but will cauſe God to withdraw himſelf from that Soul. He ſo ſoon as he finds his love and kindneſs ſlighted, cannot but withdraw coming into that Soul, and hide himſelf.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:35219:16"/>
            <p>This very cauſe we find amongſt men, where one hath done a kindneſs for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, it may be voluntarily, out of love, if he finds that he be ſlighted, and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be ſlighted and diſregarded, how can ſuch an one but take it ill, and repent him of both the kindneſs done, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him from giving, or doing any thing more, and that not without good ground of Reaſon. <hi>Ingratum est qui bene meren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti non reponit.</hi> Unthankful is he that doth not either reward a kindneſs received, at one time or another (if able) or at leaſt expreſs a willing mind, by a continued acknowledgment thereof.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But you will ſay, How? or what ſhall a man do to improve this acquaintance with God? that thereby he may obtain a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler fruition of, and have more communion with God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The beſt and ſafeſt way will be, Firſt of all to be careful to ſpeak, think, or do nothing that tends to the diſhonour of God, or his ways. God cannot but take it very unkindly from any one, for whom he hath done ſo much, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards whom his tender Bowels has been expatiated and inlarged, to whom he has unſpeably demonſtrated his infinite care and tenderneſs of affection from time to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35219:16"/>time; to be either badly or malignantly ſpoke of, or hardly thought on, or inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly wronged any way.</p>
            <p>For indeed, how can it otherwiſe be expected, whom ſhould God have to be his friends, but they to whom he has exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a multiplicity of kindneſs; of whom ſhould God be honoured, but by them whom he has honoured; and indeed there is none that has done any thing for God, but he will reward it, and that infinitely, an hundred-fold, and there is a finite number for an infinite, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.29. For we have his Word and Promiſe for it, and he is one that cannot Lye. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30. <hi>Them that honour me, I will honour.</hi> And indeed they that do not care for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring God, may expect that God will not care for honouring them; but adds immediately, and that palpably, <hi>But they that deſpiſe me, ſhall be lightly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Be ſure always in all your affairs to ſet the Lord always before your eyes, queſtioning with your ſelves, how you ſhall anſwer any thing you do, when called before the great Tribunal of the moſt high God, whether it be neither the cauſe to incur his diſpleaſure, or wound your Soul and Conſcience; and this we
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35219:17"/>find holy <hi>David</hi> in the practiſe of, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26 8. <hi>I have ſet the Lord always before me:</hi> We find <hi>Job</hi> in this ſame practiſe, <hi>Job</hi> 31.14. <hi>What ſhall I do when God riſeth up, or when he viſiteth, what ſhall I anſwer him?</hi> We find <hi>Joſeph</hi> making uſe of this Engine to reſiſt the Devil in the temptation of his Miſtreſs, <hi>How ſhall I do this great evil, and ſin againſt God?</hi> Gen. 39.9. We find theſe three Worthies always upon their watch with this Javelin; and indeed it is the reaſon many times why men run into ſo many wicked and diabolical practiſes, and ſo help forward the Devils deſigns and temptations, and congratulate the luſts of the fleſh, becauſe they do not either rightly conceive what God is, or elſe not ſet him before their eyes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let Morning and Evening Sacrifice of Prayer and Praiſe be offered up unto God;<note place="margin">To which purpoſe we have compoſed a few ſhort Prayers for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day in the week, and alſo for other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions.</note> 
               <hi>Pſ.</hi> 92.1, 2. Beware to be found prayerleſs Families, that call not on Gods Name; for why ſhould there be wrath upon your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.25. O miſerable Families that are without God in the world, that are without Family Prayer! What have you ſo many Family
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:35219:17"/>wants, Family ſins, Family mercies, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, every moment, and no Family Prayers? What is it to pray with <hi>all pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and ſupplication,</hi> to have no prayer? Beware to ſay, I have no time; what haſt thou all thy time for? haſt thou it on purpoſe to ſerve thy God, and art care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for nothing leſs than to ſerve and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie him in it: O beware of this, hath God commanded <hi>to pray continually, or without ceaſing,</hi> that is always to be in a praying frame, and art thou no more ſolicitous to obey Gods command? In a word, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is the procurer of all our Mercies, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.12. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.2, 9. It will be very requiſite that ſome preparation be made. 1. It will be of great uſe to examine how you have ſpent your time, if at Night how you have walked with God; if in the Morning how kind God hath been unto you in keeping you from all ſpiritual and corporal enemies; and conſider far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther how God might have thrown you into Hell. I remember I have read con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a Heathen, that uſed every night to ſet an hours time apart to examine himſelf how he had ſpent the anteceding day, and to beg of the gods to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don both his miſpent time, and intreat for a ſupply of his wants. And ſhall an
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:35219:18"/>Heathen ſhame thoſe that profeſs to be the Souldiers of Chriſt?</p>
            <p>Conſider what Mercies you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, or what you ſtand in need of moſt, and let the Vitals of your Soul be moſt for that, only let it be with an holy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the will of God, in and for all things, eſpecially in Temporals, or in things conducing to the Body.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When thou appear'ſt before God, let it be with an elated eſteem of the Greatneſs, Holineſs, and Purity of God, and with a regardleſs eſteem of thy ſelf; the beſt way to come unto God is by a ſelf-debaſement, ſeeing by a ſelf-ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of <hi>being as god's, knowing good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> all mankind loſt Heaven, and ſo involved themſelves into a delapſed condition; and indeed we can imitate Chriſt no more than in an humble deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to God-ward in all our Supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Moreover, ſo long as we come in the humility of our heart to God, we have Gods ingagement that he will not turn us off, he will accept us: The firſt ſtep to Exaltation is by Humility, and Self-abaſement, and abandoning all ſelf-iſhneſs; and the beſt and chiefeſt way to the attainment of this is, by the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thoughts of God, not only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:35219:18"/>of his creating &amp; providential Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in firſt creating all things of nothing, of no Being to make a Being, of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed <hi>Chaos</hi> to form a fair and ſplendid Fabrick, as the Greek word ſignifies; I ſay not only in reſpect of that great and magnificent Power by which all things were made, and alſo that provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential Power by which all things are preſerved and kept; but alſo in reſpect of the more magnificent and powerful and infinite wiſe contrivance of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and new Creation, I mean of that procuring a poſſibility, whereby man might be reſtored and redeemed from that lapſed and unſpeakably miſerable condition into which he is fallen, and that he might be brought into a nearer union and communion with God, by that Hypoſtatical Union in Jeſus Chriſt; and is there not matter of admiring both the infinite Wiſdom and Power of God, in his great Work and Contrivance? Yea, that, that might carry a Soul out of it ſelf, as it were, by admiring him in this very work.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Never come unto God but upon the account of the precious death and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a crucified Saviour, laying aſide all thine own righteouſneſs as a menſtruous
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:35219:19"/>cloth, and as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And indeed it is a great pity that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Promiſes as are made and laid down for the ſupport of poor drooping and deſponding ones, ſhould be no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded and made uſe of; it is as it were a ſlighting of Chriſts kindneſs; as if one ſhould ſay, What are theſe Promiſes to me, I matter them not, I do not ſtand in need of them; but know thou whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, if any ſuch an one, that there is a day a coming when thou wouldſt be glad to embrace ſuch a proffer. I ſay ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come in, and upon any account, but in and upon the account of the dear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer Jeſus Chriſt, this muſt needs be the ſafeſt, ſureſt, beſt, and prevailing way, for he ſaith, <hi>I am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life,</hi> John 14.6.</p>
            <p>It muſt needs be the ſafeſt and ſureſt way, to come in the Name and Strength of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe he is able, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.15. If he take thy cauſe in hand, and thou committeſt it to him with an holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:35219:19"/>undoubtedly he will carry it on, and crown it with perfection; all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means may fail, all other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents may miſcarry, but he will, nay, he can never miſcarry; <hi>He ſhall ſee of the travel of his Soul, he ſhall and will bring judgment unto victory.</hi> He is able to reſiſt the moſt invincible temptation, and evade the moſt intricate Stratagems the Devil can make; he has conquered Death and Hell, and given the Devil ſuch a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning blow, as that he can never be able to encounter one Battle more with him. All Power is in his hand in <hi>Heaven and Earth, Matth.</hi> 28.18. And if he be ſo able, as that all Power both in Heaven and Earth is in his hand, what ſafer and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer way, than coming to God by him; none ſhall be able to pluck thee nor thy cauſe out of his hand; the Devil may aſſault thee, he may in many ſhapes and forms, but he ſhall never prevail againſt thee. When thou prayeſt, it may be he'll endeavour to diſtract thee, when thou comeſt before God, he will accuſe thee, as he did righteous <hi>Job;</hi> for he is called, <hi>The Accuſer of his Brethren,</hi> Revel. 12.10. The Power of Chriſt hath, and ſhall caſt him down; <hi>He hath overcome him by his precious blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="14" facs="tcp:35219:20"/>
            <p n="2">2. It muſt needs be the ſafeſt; becauſe he is one with the Father, and the Father cannot deny him any requeſt; <hi>He hears him always,</hi> John 11.42. <hi>I know that thou hearest me always.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. There is no other way: Let others pretend to what they will, and to aboliſh the Prieſtly Office of Chriſt, and ſo rob him of his Right and Honour, yet it is moſt plain, <hi>He is the way, the Truth, and the Life,</hi> and none other; he is the only beloved, in whom God is abundantly well-pleaſed; and he it is that muſt take our imperfect deſires, and offer them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God in his own perfection; our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs muſt be ſupplied in his ſtrength, our emptineſs in his fulneſs, our unrighteous Prayers muſt be perfumed with the odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riferous ſmell of his ſpotleſs and blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>It is moſt certain, That Man by the Fall loſt all his Righteouſneſs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore imperfection can never appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, who is infinitely perfect; all fulneſs dwells in himſelf; and how can he look upon meer emptineſs, unleſs it be in the fulneſs of his own Son.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Dare not to appear before God with any ſin unrepented of knowing that like an Adder that a poor man found,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:35219:20"/>though almoſt dead, as ſoon as it reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered ſtrength and life by the heat of the fire, began to hiſs at him.

            <p>And wouldſt thou be bleſſed, counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance no ſin, but reſolve againſt all ſin in the ſtrength of Chriſt; all ſin in general, and every ſin in particular, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of God and Man. <hi>If I regard ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in my heart, God will not hear my prayer,</hi> Pſal. 66.8. ſaith <hi>David;</hi> and let it be ſaid of thee, as it was ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Athanaſius</hi> by <hi>Nazianzen, Se eſſe Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netem &amp; Adamantem dicit,</hi> in reſpect of his ſweet drawing and winning nature; and yet an Adamant in reſpect of his ſtout courage againſt ſin; and in an eſpecial manner, theſe three empoyſoning ſins, 1 Malice and Anger. 2.

O therefore be ſure to put away all idleneſs: And to ſtir thee up to this duty, Conſider what is like to be the portion of thoſe lazy drones whoſe ſloth the very Inſects condemn. The little Ant, and the Bee, how do they buſie themſelves to lay up againſt Winter, againſt a Storm, only being led by the Inſtinct of Nature: Well then may theſe careleſs Sots be termed to that ſlothful Butter-fly, that takes care for nothing but painting her wings, ſo that when win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter comes, puts her head into a hole and dies. <hi>The ſluggard will not plow by reaſon of the cold, therefore he ſhall beg in harveſt, and have nothing:</hi> When others come with their ſhocks rejoycing, he ſhall

Keep thy Spirits, and all the Faculties of thy Soul, at work in thy ſolitary Ceſſations, leſt that like two Mill-ſtones, wanting Grift, they grind one another to pieces: and the beſt thing to keep thy ſelf imployed in, will be to be much in the heart-ſearching work; to ſee how thy heart ſtands affected with God, for that either ſweetens or empoyſons all the reſt; the heart is the Inlet of Vertues and Vices: An Hoſt it is that entertains all ſorts of Gueſts, and needs to be eyed. Moreover, Purity in the inward parts is the moſt unerring and infallible teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and evidence of a good and ſound ſtate; therefore ſearch it, try it by the Word of Light and Life, that true Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone. 2. See how thy Will ſtands for God, the Will being the Seat of the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it is very requiſite that it be purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: See how its Pulſe beats, queſtion it, What art thou willing to do, to ſuffer, to under-go, to forſake for God? Art thou willing to ſtand to Gods Cauſe in all tryals? and endure all tempeſts and ſtorms? Art thou willing to be imployed in what Office Chriſt ſhall put upon thee? and that to the hazard of thy Eſtate, thy Houſes, thy Lands, Goods, Wife, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Life and all? I ſay if thy Will be

            <p>Then they ſhall feel the puniſhment both of ſenſe and loſs; then they ſhall have God's Vials of wrath and indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on poured upon them; then they ſhall be ſenſible of that devouring fire that God ſo many times, by his faithful Miniſters, hath preſſed upon them; that fire that either conſumes or refines the world, ſhall burn the ſinner to all Eternity, and yet ſhall neither be conſumed nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined; always a dying, but never dead, And then how will his merry days be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed as a dream, and his jovial life will be as a tale that is told, and his Repar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:35219:31"/>pleaſant Sports, and wanton Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances, his Cups and Queans, his vain hopes of Heaven, and confident Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, all, all deceaſed, all will be paſs'd away together.</p>
            <p>This is the time that ſinners, that the wretched world ſhall be diſcrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the happy Saints; whoſe miſery and property is to be wiſe too late. The Vizard of the World will then be taken off, it will be then unvailed, and then the ſeeming holineſs of the Hypocrite will be conſpicuous, and will be expoſed to the face and view of all the world, and then ſhall he ſee his own folly, not only in reference to his own Soul, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in ſlighting Chriſt, offered to him in the Goſpel; then he ſhall ſee how nigh he came to the Kingdom of Heaven, and yet came ſhert of it; and how ſhall he expect or imagine to be hid in the day of the Lords anger, that knew that his Judge every day was looking on when he ſo diſſembled and cheated the world, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and God, as he ſuppoſed.

            <p>What a deplorable condition will it be, to think, how the Maſter ſhall evidence againſt his own Servant, the Husband a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Wife, and the Wife againſt the Husband, the Parents againſt their own Children, and the Children againſt their own Parents: Sinful Compotators, or Pot-Companions little conjecture they muſt bear witneſs of, and concerning, thoſe ſins that they have helped for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in others, and they themſelves heard and did; ſwearing and execrating, and mocking thoſe that feared God, and ſcoffing at an holy Life.

Where, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they ſlighted Gods Miniſters, and ſtrivings of God's Spirit within them. The very Angels will witneſs againſt them at that day, and Conſcience will produce its black Bill of his ſecret reclamings, and of all the Examples that have ever been, to demonſtrate the diſpleaſure and hatred God has againſt ſuch ſins, as they have been Aſſenters to, and Agents in. <hi>In turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Grace of God into wantonneſs,</hi> and in gaming and ſquandring away preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous time; in which time, inſtead <hi>of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out their own ſalvation,</hi> they have wrought out their damnation.

            <p>There were four ſorts of Hearers ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in Chriſt's Parable, but one ſort good; the reſt were Sabbath-breakers, ſuch as there are many now a-days, that inſtead of getting their hearts prepared, according to the preparation of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, to meet with God, and hear what he will diſpenſe to them from his Word, they trim, paint, and pin away a good Conſcience, in trimming, and painting, and pinning their Bodies. Where is that that the Scripture commands?

            <p>I have read a notable Story, wherein we have (by way of diſcourſe) betwixt a Begger and a <hi>Divine,</hi> a notable Example of Self-reſignation, and an high Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Perfection (I mean) as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>perfectio partium non graduum,</hi> of parts not of degrees; for it can be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, it is impoſſible to be as perfect as God.

            <p>There was a certain Divine, famous in Learning and Piety, that did earneſtly importune God by prayer, for ſome time together, conceiving that he had not the true knowledge of the ways of God, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his much Learning attained belong Studies; begging that God would give him to know more of him, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and that God would direct him to ſome that would teach him the way of Truth; and being in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lamed at a certain time, with vehemency of deſire, a Voice, as was ſuppoſed, ſpake thus to him, <hi>Go forth to the Church yard, and there thou
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:35219:34"/>mayeſt find a man that can teach thee the way.</hi> And going forth, he found there a certain Beggar, with patched and torn Apparel, and filthy dirty feet, whoſe cloaths were not worth three half-pence, whom he ſpake thus unto: Divine. <hi>God give thee a good morning. Beggar.</hi> Sir, I do not remember that ever I had an evil one. Div. <hi>God make thee fortunate and proſperous: Why ſpeakeſt thou on this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner?

Sir, Thou didſt wiſh me a proſperous and good Motn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and I anſwered, I never had an evil one; for when I am pinched with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, I praiſe God; if I ſuffer cold, if it ſnow, if it hail or rain, if the weather be fair or foul, I praiſe God; and therefore there never happened any <hi>ſad or evil Morning to me.</hi> Thou didſt likewiſe wiſh that I might be <hi>fortunate,</hi> I ſaid I was never unfortunate, becauſe whatever God gave me, I ſuffered, or whatever hapned to me, whether it were <hi>agreeable to me,</hi> or otherwiſe; were it <hi>ſweet</hi> or <hi>bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to me, I gladly received it at his hands, <hi>as the best;</hi> and therefore I was never <hi>unfortunate.</hi> Thou ſaidſt moreover, that

Div. <hi>This is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrange; but what (I pray thee) wouldeſt thou do, if the Lord of Majeſty ſhould caſt thee into the bottomleſs pit, couldſt thou be content with his will? Beg.</hi> Drown me in the bottomleſs pit? Why certainly if he ſhould, I have two arms by which I would ſtill embrace him; the one is true Humility, and that I lay under him, and by him I am united to his ſacred Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: The other, and that is the right one, which is Love, which is united to his Divinity; and alſo by this Love from himſelf, I hold him ſo faſt, that he would go down to Hell with me; and it is much better for me to be in Hell with God, than in Heaven without him.</p>
            <p>By this the <hi>Divine</hi> learned, That the moſt compendious way to God is a true

            <p>Hereupon the <hi>Divine</hi> ſpake again to the Beggar, and asked him. Div. <hi>Whence comeſt thou? Beg.</hi> From God. Div. <hi>Where foundeſt thou God? Beg.</hi> Even there where I left all the Creatures. Div. <hi>I pray thee friend, Who art thou? Beg.</hi> Who am I?

O therefore for thy own Names ſake, do away all my ſins in the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, that I may appear before thee in the Robes of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, and and not in mine own; ſeeing all mine is but as menſtruous cloth, and filthy rags.

                  <p>HOly Lord, what great cauſe have I to bleſs thee, that thou haſt pleaſed to preſerve me all this week, and keep me in the midſt of all the viciſſitudes of this ſickle and unconſtant world; and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt me yet again to come before thee by way of duty. Grant that I may not look upon it as a Duty only, but as a Priviledg, and that a great one, a Priviledge that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny enjoy not. And what am I more than they? I have been guilty of ſins both for

Work in me, Lord, a more active frame of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that I may bring more honour to thy Name: let the fruits of Grace, ſpring more apparently in my life. Let thy Word teach me, thy Spirit guide and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie me, thy Son redeem me, thy Power pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve me, and thy Providence ſuſtain me: Yea, let all work together for the beſt for me.

Qualifie me and prepare me for ſuch a work as thy Sabbath expects from me, according to the preparation of thy Sanctuary; and being prepared I may meet with thy Self: let thy Word be ſweet to my Soul, let it deſcend as rain upon the new-mown Graſs; let it water my dry and parched Soul; and let the influences of thy Spirit accompany it, that it may be effectual to the ſaving of my Soul.

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Sabbath</hi> amongſt the Hebrews is called <hi>Schabbat, Schebbet,</hi> or <hi>Schabbathon,</hi> that is, a Ceſſation, vacation from la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or reſt. Moreover, it is called a Day, by God devoted for his Worſhip, and that for four Reaſons: 1. Becauſe God on that day reſted from his work of Creation, although not from his Work of Providence. 2. Becauſe that the Sabbath is the Image or Repreſentative of that ſpiritual and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Reſt from ſin. 3. Becauſe on this day we ought to reſt from our Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks, from our Houſhold Affairs, that God might imploy us in his Work. 4. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:35219:49"/>that our Servants, and labouring Beaſts might reſt on that Day.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Duplex enim eſt Sabbathum,</hi> the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath is two-fold: 1. Moral and Internal, or 2. Ceremonial, or External. Firſt, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Internal,</hi> or <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and that is the deſire of the knowledge of God and his Works, to the end that we may avoid ſin, and ſerve God both in word and deed. In a word, It is an abſtaining from ſin, and exerciſing the Works of God, and worſhipping him, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66.23.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Ceremonial,</hi> or <hi>External,</hi> and that is an appointed, and ſet time; ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in the Church, for the miniſtration of the Sacraments, and diſpenſing the Word, and other things appointed of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and this is either <hi>Mediately</hi> or <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately</hi> from God himſelf, appointed and laid down to the Church in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which alſo is divers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A Sabbath of days, which is every Seventh day of the Week, peculiarly ſo called, becauſe of God's reſting from his Creation work, and for his people to reſt on. Thence by the <hi>Hebrews</hi> by a Synec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche, the whole week was called <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bathum,</hi> or <hi>Sabbatha,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Sabbath of Months, <hi>Neomeniae</hi> (viz.) <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>nova Luna,</hi> the time of the New Moon.</p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:35219:50"/>
               <p n="3">3. A Sabbath of Years <hi>(viz.)</hi> every Seventh year, in which the Jewiſh peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were not to ſow their ground, <hi>Lev.</hi> 2.3, 4, 26, 35. <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>More Mediate,</hi> or external, which God appointed by his Church in the New Teſtament, which is the firſt day of the week, namely, the Lords Day; which was obſerved by the Chriſtian Church from the time of the Apoſtles, inſtead of the ſeventh day, and that in reſpect of the Reſurrection of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>As to the ſecond</hi> (viz.) <hi>of what uſe the Sabbath is to Chriſtians?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Sabbath from the beginning was appointed by God, to the end that Man by God's Example, might reſt from all his Works, eſpecially from ſin; and afterward was renewed in the Moſaical Law, to the end God might ſhew, that yet he would honour the Sabbath more, in ſanctifying it to his Church; namely, that he would forgive their ſins, and receive them into his favour, by the Meſſiah promiſed to their Fathers, and that to be exhibited or held forth in his time; and this may ſerve for a Reaſon, why the Ceremonial Sabbath (<hi>viz.</hi> the Seventh day is aboliſhed; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is repreſented the bounty of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, and alſo puts us in mind of his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:35219:50"/>upon which acccount all the reſt of the Sacraments, Sacrifices, and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies inſtituted before and after the Law, were aboliſhed by the coming of Chriſt; notwithſtanding this Sabbath's abrogation in the New Teſtament, yet the Moral Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath is permanent, and is of great uſe to us; namely, that we might have a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time appointed for the work and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God: it being no leſs neceſſary that a certain day be inſtituted now, in the Chriſtian, as well as formerly in the Jewiſh Church, for the diſpenſing of the Word, and adminiſtring, publickly, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of God.</p>
               <p>Moreover, we are not limited to any day of the week ſtrictly, as ſome will have it, as the third, fourth, or fifth, or any other; and therefore the Apoſtolical Church being free by the gift of, or if you will, by that liberty freely beſtowed by Chriſt, for diſtinction ſake, to wit, between them and the Jewiſh Synagogue, they uſed the Firſt day for the Seventh; for this probable Reaſon, that on that day of Chriſt's Reſurrection, our ſpiritual and internal Sabbath was begun in us. In a word, we are bound to a Ceremonial Sabbath, <hi>in genere, ſed non in ſpecie;</hi> that is, that we ought to have a day wherein
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:35219:51"/>the Church may be taught, and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments adminiſtred, yet limited to no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain day.</p>
               <p>Obj. 1. <hi>The Decalogue is a perpetual Law (may ſome ſay) The Command concerning the Sabbath is of the Decalogue, therefore the Law is perpetual.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> True. The Decalogue is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual as it is Moral, but the Appendices or Determinations of Moral Commands, in reſpect of ſignification, were only to be kept till the coming of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Obj. 2. <hi>The Precepts of the Decalogue belong to all: This is a Precept of the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, therefore this belongs to all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> Granted, as touching its Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; but it is alſo Ceremonial in part, and ſo it doth not belong to us <hi>niſi quo ad ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> The Reaſons are evident. 1. Sr. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Let none judge you in meat or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the New Moon, or of the Sabhath.</hi> 2. The Apoſtles themſelves changed the Seventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days Sabbath. 3. From the end of the Law, it was a Type of things to be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Chriſt (to wit) of Sanctification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Type muſt needs be abrogated, the thing typified being produced.</p>
               <p>Obj. 3. <hi>The Lord ſaith of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, That it is a ſign for ever between him
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:35219:51"/>and the children of Iſrael. Therefore the Sabbath is not to be aboliſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> The Ceremonial Sabbath is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual, until Chriſt, which is the end of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies. 2. The Sabbath is eternal <hi>quo ad rem ſignificatam,</hi> which is a ceſſation from ſin, and reſt in God; and ſo of all other Types in the Old Teſtament; yea, the Kingdom of <hi>David,</hi> which was deſtroyed at the coming of the Meſſiah.</p>
               <p>Obj. 4. <hi>The Laws given before</hi> Moſes<hi>'s time, were immutable: The Seventh-days Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was inſtituted before</hi> Moſes<hi>'s: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sevenths-days Sabbath is immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, provided that we aſſent that</hi> Moſes<hi>'s Laws were mutable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> 'Tis only true in the Moral Law; 'tis denied in the Ceremonial. Theſe Types before <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhewing the bounty of the Meſſiah, were aboliſht at his comming; as Circumciſion given to <hi>Abraham.</hi> In like manner, the Sacrifices either commanded to our firſt Parents, or practiſed by them.</p>
               <p>Object. 5. <hi>The Laws given by God before the Fall, were not Types of the Bounties of Chriſt, all grant; the promiſe of the</hi> Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah <hi>being not as then given: although the condition of the whole humane race was one and the ſame. The Seventh days Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was inſtituted before the Fall of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind:
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:35219:52"/>therefore it is univerſal and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp. Per diſtinctionem materiis,</hi> which is true concerning the Moral Law; whoſe natural knowledge was imprinted in the mind of man in the Creation; but not concerning the Seventh day Sabbaths Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony; which after the fall, in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical Law, is made a type of the benefits of the Meſſiah. And beſides all this, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ceremonies, whether inſtituted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or after, by the Meſſias were made obnoctious to change; for God will not let them remain under the ſhaddows, the things themſelves being exhibited.</p>

                  <p>Omoſt holy, great, and glorious God; thou that art the reſt of thy poor Creatures; the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whom thou haſt inſtituted Lord of the Sabbath; in whoſe ſtrength we deſire to approach thy holy preſence, this thy holy Sabbath-day, a day of thy own appointment, wherein thou wilt be found in an eſpecial manner: and as it is to be a day of reſt for all fleſh, after thine own inſtitution, Lord help us not only to reſt from our ordinary Labours and Imployments, but from any thing that may be diſconſonant to thy Will and Word; not doing our own actions, nor ſpeaking our own words, nor thinking our own thoughts; that thereby we (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prepared according to the preparation
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:35219:55"/>of thy Sanctuary) may be in the Spirit on the Lords Day, to meet with thee, and by meeting with thee, we may hear thee communicate ſome ſweet truth to us, whereby we may be drawn nigher to thy ſelf, by the blood of Chriſt. And ſeeing thou waſt pleaſed, Lord, to honour this day, by the Reſurrection of our bleſſed Redeemer; let us have more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from thy ſelf this day, that we are riſen with him, having conquered by him <hi>Death, Grave, Hell,</hi> and <hi>Sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O let us ſee him whom our ſins have pierced, that we by faith may mortifie that that crucified him, and let us have a glimpſe of our beloved in his glory; and let us this day hearken to his voice, that we may know to love what he loves, and hate what he hates; to be in love with ſanctity and holineſs, and to be at enmity with every ſimilitude of ſin, which will hinder our ſervices, this day, in his name, to be as a ſweet ſmell in Gods Noſtrils. Help us to hold faſt our hope and confidence in God unto the end; and let that conſidence be a perfect aſſurance that we have an intereſt in Jeſus. Let the word preached be mixed with ſaith, let it be quick and powerful, and piercing, that it may accompliſh that end for which

Let not Satan come and catch away the Seed; but O that it may be as ſeed ſown in good and honeſt hearts, bringing forth fruit with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, meet for repentance; and let it be for the weakning of ſin, but for the ſtrengthening of faith and grace. Let thy Word be as <hi>Manna</hi> for our poor Souls to feed upon, for the week to come, that thereby we may grow up in grace as we grow in years. Let thy word be a ſutable word unto every one of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; and come thou into our Souls with it, with the freeſt influence of thy Spirit, that we may of a truth meet with God, communicating of himſelf unto us, by his Word and Spirit.</p>

If in thy ſelf thou ſeekeſt it, remember what thou art a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Wilt thou have the Lord bound and obliged to thee? Wilt thou be thine own Saviour? or ſhall it be ſaid his mercy ſaved thee not? If no Miſery were in thee, whereupon ſhould his mercy be manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted? and if thy Diſpoſition in the Earth, were every way ſuch as it ſhould be, then what remaineth but that the praiſe of his Mercy ſhould leſs appear: turn thee therefore unto me, and ſeek thy ſelf in me.

Eſteemeſt thou that my wounds are ineffectual, or that there is no force in my ſufferings; count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou this, as that my Vertue and Merit cannot cure them?

Have I not made thee a wreſtler againſt thine inordinate luſts? Have I not given thee ſtrength many a time to ſtand againſt Sathans tentations, whereas if I had left thee to thy ſelf, how oft hadſt thou been made a prey to thine enemy?</p>
                  <p>Remembereſt thou not that the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath aſſaulted thee, but I have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn the occaſion of thy ſin, and when the occaſion ſerved did I not reſtrain and hold back the Tempter? yea, when both the occaſion and the Tempter were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, have I not filled thy heart with the fear and love of my Name; and ſo kept thee from ſinning againſt me? And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as many times thou of thy weakneſs haſt offended, did I not with a melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heart and a mourning Eye, raiſe thee again, and renew my former familiarity with thee? ſo that thou canſt never ſay from the firſt hour I began to renew thee, that I ſuffered thee to lie in thy ſins, as

                  <p>Are not theſe undoubted tokens of my Grace in thee? Will Nature do ſuch things? Mayeſt not thou feel that by theſe I have begun to apply to thee my merit for the remiſſion of thy ſins, and my vertue for quickning thee to a new life? Therefore think of thy ſelf as baſely as thou wilt, but let the work of my Grace be eſteemed of thee, according to the excellency of it. Be humble and caſt down when thou lookeſt upon thine own corruption, I find no fault with thee; but I rejoyce at the new workmanſhip I have begun in thee. Indeed, if there were nothing in thee, but that which thou haſt of Nature, thy eſtate were mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable: but ſeeing thou ſeeſt a new workmanſhip in thee, be comforted. Art thou ſo in darkneſs that there is no light in thee? that beſides it, there is not in thee a will to do good alſo, and a love to righteouſneſs? If thou ſayeſt thou haſt no ſin in thee, thou art a liar; and thinkeſt thou that I who have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to tranſlate thee from darkneſs to light and to make thee a new creature;
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:35219:92"/>will leave thee, until I have done my work in and upon thee? Therefore beloved, give not ear to thine own Corruption and Satan, as to take their teſtimony againſt thee, or to make thee think that my pledges that I have given thee, are not worthy of credit; that by them thou ſhouldeſt be aſſured of mercy.</p>

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:35219:93"/>Thou wouldeſt take the place of thy Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for thy home, and the Earneſt for the Principal Summe which I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed thee Conſider this wifely with thy ſelf, that albeit I ſmile not alike on thee at all times; and fill thee not always with my Joys, yet I always love thee; if thou continue in my Love: for whom I love I love unto the end. If I cloſe my Chamber door upon thee; it is not to hold thee out: it is to learn thee to knock. If I cover my ſelf with many vails, that thou canſt not ſee a glance of my loving Countenance; 'tis only to ſtir thee up to ſeek me: and if ſometimes I ſeem to go from thee, 'tis to provoke thee to follow me; that thou mayeſt make haſte from the Earth to Heaven, where thou ſhalt injoy me without intermiſſion. Was <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſo wiſe as to conceal his tender affection from his Brethren, till he brought them to an humble acknowledgment of their ſin? And was he again ſo loving, as when he ſaw them ſo humbled, his affection was enflamed, and compelled him to reveal himſelf unto them? And thinkeſt thou that I am leſs wiſe and loving in dealing with mine? I gave at firſt ſharp anſwers to that Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Canaans</hi> Petitions; and ſo will I, to deal roughly, ſeemingly, with thoſe
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:35219:93"/>whom I love, and to be angry, even at their Prayers; but in the end I will make my love manifeſt to them, and with mine endleſs mercies imbrace them</p>

If we ſaw that ſuch were our Diſpoſition, as thy holy Word doth require in us, then ſhould thy comforts rejoyce us: but alas, how far am I from that which I ſhould be; my ſtrength is enfeebled, therefore do mine inordinate affections oft-times overcharge me. If I turn me to pray, I cannot for the hardneſs of mine heart; the contrite ſpirit, the melting heart, the mourning eye is gone from me. If I ſeek comfort in thy Word I find it not: I am troubled alſo with doubtings; armies of fears and ſorrows are againſt me, and all through weakneſs of my faith; partly for want of that light that ſhould inform me; my infidelity abuſeth me to think that thy viſitations come from thine anger; and cauſeth me to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Reproofs of my conſcience, as if they were juſt occaſions; and partly for want of that apprehending and applying Vertue that is in Faith.

                  <p>As for the weakneſs of thy faith, which I ſee is the ground of all thy trouble, it proceedeth either from the want of knowledge, or elſe from the want of Application: 'Tis indeed a ſpecial be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, to have the mind enlightned with true light: ſeek therefore my light to ſhine unto thee, by continual Prayer, and ſeeking into the Scriptures, that thou be not troubled with the error of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; as if it were a juſt accuſation. I have indeed ſet conſcience to be a warner unto thee; but then ſhalt thou take heed to her warnings, when they are warranted by my Word. If the error of thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence terrifie thee in any thing, and make thee think that thy Croſſes and Viſitations do come from mine anger; go and inform conſcience better by the Word: <hi>Remember
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:35219:95"/>whom I chaſtiſe, I love;</hi> and when I cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe thee, I am not ſeeking ſatisfaction to my juſtice: What wonder ſuch thoughts diſquiet many?

But Lord let thy Light abide with me, that I ſin no more with ſuch diſtruſtful motions

What ſmaller thing is there than a Grain of Muſtard-ſeed, albeit the meaſure of thy faith were no more, yet have I not exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it from the participations of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. A loving Father will delight to be holden by the hand of his tender Child, and knoweſt thou not, <hi>that as a Father ſpareth his Son; ſo will the Lord ſpare him that fears him.</hi> Haſt thou not read that although the faith of my Servant <hi>Jacob,</hi> was very weak, as thou mayeſt perceive by the great fear he conceived of <hi>Eſau;</hi> yet his weak faith was able to hold me till I Bleſſed him: be not therefore diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; for albeit, thou canſt not lay hold with the hand of ſtrong faith, if thou canſt but touch the Hem of my Garment with thy Finger, thou ſhalt draw vertue out of me. Conſider alſo with thy ſelf, that the faith of my Children is never greater, than when their feeling is weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and leaſt perceived. 'Tis eaſie for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:35219:96"/>one to believe, in the mid'ſt of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious feelings, and unſpeakable joys: but when a man can feel no comfort in me, and yet believeth on me, and waiteth on me for comfort, certainly the faith of that man is great. And ſuch was the faith of my ſervant, who in his greateſt trouble gave me this anſwer, <hi>Albeit thou ſlay me, yet will I truſt in thee, O Lord,</hi> Yet both againſt ſenſe and feeling. And did not alſo that Woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceable ſaith cleave unto my mercy, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven then when ſhe had no feeling of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.

                  <p>O deceitful Serpent, if I have found ſuch error ariſing from thoſe ſins which

                  <p>The Lord confirm this good purpoſe of my heart, that I never hearken any more to thy lying words; and ſuffer not my Soul to be circumvented with thy deceitful ſnares: And as for the work of my Salvation, ſeeing it is a work that my God will work in ſpite of thee; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall I regard thy teſtimony? Thou didſt put it into queſtion to my Saviour, whether or no he was the Son of God; and what wonder if thou dareſt ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Children, that they are none of his? Is there any truth ſo undoubted that thou wilt not deny at any time? Why ſhall I enter into diſputing with thee any more?

Speak what thou wilt, thou art always like thy ſelf; thou haſt been a liar from the beginning; curſed of the Lord art thou in all thy ways, and with all thy confederates: Curſed are they that are in friendſhip with thee, and bleſſed for ever be the Lord that hath delivered me from thy deceit and tyranny.</p>

I beſeech thee out of the abundance of thy Pity to heal my Infirmity, to waſh my Foulneſs, to enlighten my Darkneſs and Blindneſs, to enrich my Poverty, to cloth my Nakedneſs, that I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Bread of Angels. O thou the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, grant that I may receive thee with ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and reverence, with ſuch contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and fear, with ſuch faith and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with ſuch a purpoſe and humility, as is expedient for my Soul.</p>

               <p n="1">1. IT is folly to think that we ſhould have Phyſick and Health both at one time; reſolve therefore upon wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his leiſure: after a weary Week comes a Sabbath; and after a Fight Victory.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Unkindneſs of others to us is but a correction of our unkindneſs to God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He that can't abound without Pride and High-mindedneſs, will never want without too much dejectedneſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let us not ſeek our ſelves abroad out of our ſelves, in the conceits of other men: That man ſhall never lie quiet that hath not learned to ſet light by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers cauſeleſs ill conceits.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Them that ſet too high a price upon themſelves, where others will not come up to their price, they are diſcontented.</p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:35219:103"/>
               <p n="6">6. Thoſe whoſe condition is above their worth, and their pride above their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſhall never want forrow; yet we muſt maintain our Authority in our places, for that is Gods and not ours; and we ought ro carry our ſelves ſo as that we may approve our ſelves to their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, though we can't have their good word.</p>
               <p n="7">7. One end why God ſuffereth the Soul to tire and beat it ſelf, is, that finding no reſt in it ſelf, it might ſeek to God.</p>
               <p n="8">8. A man can be in no condition, wherein God is at a loſs; if comfort be wanting, he can create Comfort, not only out of nothing, but out of diſcomfort: He made the Whale that ſwallowed <hi>Jonas,</hi> a means to bring him to Land.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The only way to have our will, is to bring it to Gods Will.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The way patiently to ſuffer Gods will, is, to enure our ſelves to do it; they that have not enured themſelves to the yoke of obedience, will never endure the yoke of ſuffering.</p>
               <p n="11">11. When we can ſay to God, Wilt thou have me poor and diſregarded, I am well content? Thus a gedly Man ſays <hi>Amen</hi> to Gods <hi>Amen,</hi> and puts his <hi>Fiat</hi> to Gods <hi>Fiat.</hi>

               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:35219:104"/>
               <p n="12">12. None feel more Experience of Gods Providence, than thoſe that are moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute in their obedience.</p>
               <p n="13">13 After we have given Glory to God, by relying upon his Wiſdom, Power, Strength and Truth, we ſhall find him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying theſe for our Direction, Aſſiſtance, and bringing things to our deſired Iſſue; yea, above what we deſire or thought of.</p>
               <p n="14">14. The more Paſſion, the leſs Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; becauſe Paſſion hinders the ſight of what is to be done.</p>
               <p n="15">15. It is good to obſerve the particular Becks of Providence, how things joyn and meet together: Fit occaſions, and ſuiting of things, are intimation of Gods Will. Providence hath a Languags, which is well underſtood by thoſe that have fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar acquaintance with God: They ſee a train of Providence leading one way more then another.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Labour to fit a promiſe to every condition thou art in. There is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition but hath a promiſe ſuitable to it.</p>
               <p n="17">17. He that loveth too much, will grieve too much. It is the greatneſs of our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection that cauſeth our Affliction.</p>
               <p n="18">18. All our noiſe proceeds from a Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Vapour of Pride: It is Air incloſed in
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:35219:104"/>the Bowels of the Earth, that ſhakes it, which all the four Winds can't do.</p>
               <p n="19">19. There is an Art of bearing troubles, if we can learn it without over-troubling our ſelves; as in bearing a burthen, there is a way to poize it that it weigh not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heavy; if it hang on one ſide it poizeth the Body down: the greater part we pull on our ſelves, by not imparting our Care, ſo as to take upon us only the care of duty, and leave the reſt to God.</p>
               <p n="20">20. We muſt not mingle our Paſſions with our Croſſes; like fooliſh Patients, chewing the Pills which they ſhould ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low dovvn.</p>
               <p n="21">21. He that ſees not God every where, ſees him no where.</p>

               <p n="23">23. In Proſperity fear God, in Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity love God.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Praying will make thee leave ſinning, or ſinning make thee leave praying.</p>
               <p n="25">25. Our weakneſs and inabilities break not the bond of our duties.</p>
               <p n="26">26. No ſin but is eaſier kept out than caſt out.</p>
               <p n="27">27. What we are afraid to do before men, we ſhould be afraid to think before God.</p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:35219:105"/>
               <p n="28">28. Nature vexed and Nature armed, ſoon diſcovers it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="29">29. They that retain the memory of mercies, ſeldom loſe the ſight of mercies.</p>
               <p n="30">30. What unthankfulneſs is this, to think upon two or three croſſes, ſo as to forget an hundred bleſſings? What folly is it to darken our Spirits, and to indiſpoſe our ſelves to the taking or doing of good.</p>
               <p n="31">31. A Limb out of joynt, can do nothing without deformity and pain: Dejection takes off the wheels of the Soul: Joy is as Oyl to the Soul, it makes Duties come off chearfully from our ſelves, pleaſing to others, and acceptable to God.</p>
               <p n="32">32. Let us go on to add Grace unto Grace; a growing Chriſtian is always a comſortable Chriſtian: the Oyl of Grace will bring forth the Oyl of Gladneſs.</p>
               <p n="33">33. Melancholy Perſons are things that ſeem black and dark to themſelves; their Souls are as it were dead-black: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever comes to a Melancholy Perſon, comes in a dark way to his Soul.</p>
               <p n="34">34. In all grievances, let us look to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that may comfort us as well as diſcourage us; let us look as well to what we enjoy, as to what we want. As in Proſperity God mingles ſome croſs to
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:35219:105"/>diet us, ſo in all croſſes there is ſome thing to comſort us. As there is vanity lieth hid in the beſt worldly good, ſo there is a bleſſing lies hid in the greateſt worldly evil.</p>
               <p n="35">35. We muſt neither bring ſin to, nor min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle ſin with, our ſufferings; for that will trouble the Soul more than the trouble it ſelf: We are not hurt till our Souls be hurt.</p>
               <p n="36">36. In ſudden encounters ſome ſin doth many times diſcover it ſelf, the ſeed whereof lieth hid in our hearts; which we think our ſelves free from: What cauſe have we then to fear continually, that we are worſe than we take our ſelves to be? The force of Gun-powder is not known till ſome ſparks lite in it.</p>
               <p n="37">37. What a ſight were it to ſee the Feet where the Head is, and the Earth to be where the Heaven is? To the Spiritual Eye it ſeems as great a deformity to ſee the Soul to be under ſinful paſſions.</p>
               <p n="38">38. A good heart, when any Corruption is diſcovered, by a ſearching Miniſtry, is affected, as though it found out ſome dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enemy. Techineſs and Paſſion argues Guilt.</p>
               <p n="39">39. The imaginary grievances of this life are more than the real.</p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:35219:106"/>
               <p n="40">40. The way to expel Wind out of the Body, is to take wholeſome Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſo to expel Windy Fancies from the Soul, is to feed upon Serious Truths: Our beſt way, therefore is, to propound three objects to the mind; as 1. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the greatneſs and goodneſs of God. 2. The Joys of Heaven, and the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell: And 3. The laſt and ſtrict day of account. 4. The vanity of Earthly Things. 5. The uncertainty of our Lives.</p>
               <p n="41">41. A Man naturally is weaving Spiders Webbs, or hatching Cockatrice Eggs; exerciſed either in miſchief or vanity.</p>
               <p n="42">42. It would much avail, to the well-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of our thoughts, to ſet our Souls in order every morning, and to ſtreng-then and perfume every morning our Spirits with ſome gracious Meditations, eſpecially of the chief end and ſcope, wherefore we live; and how every thing may be reduced and ordered, to farther the main (that is to ſay) Gods Glory and our own Salvation.</p>
               <p n="43">43. Some will be content to embrace Truth without hatred of the World; and Chriſt without a Croſs, and a Godly Life without a Perſecution: They will pull a Roſe without Pricks: Such empty conceits will be too weak to encounter with ſuch real Trials.</p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:35219:106"/>
               <p n="44">44. It is a courſe that will have a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing attended, to joyn in a league, one to watch over another, and to obſerve each others ways; Tis uſual to joyn in Prayer, why not in this.</p>
               <p n="45">45. Happy is he that in the way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven meets with a chearful and skilful Guid and fellow Traveller, that carrieth Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bials againſt all faintings of Spirit.</p>
               <p n="46">46. There is an heavy imputation on them that comforted not the weak; when men will not own others in trouble, but as the herd of Deer, forſake and puſh away the wounded from them.</p>
               <p n="47">47. God often ſuſpends comforts from us, to make uſe of our Chriſtian Friends, by whom he purpoſeth to do us good: Oftentimes the very opening of mens griefs brings eaſe, without any farther workings upon them; the very opening of a Vein cooleth the Blood.</p>
               <p n="48">48. A Chriſtian, when he is beaten out of all other comforts, yet hath a God to turn unto; he can wreſtle with him with his own Strength, and plead with him with his own Arguments.</p>
               <p n="49">49. Labour to anſwer every relation wherein thou ſtandeſt to God; 1. As a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by truſting to his care. 2. A Teacher, by following his Direction. 3. A Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:35219:107"/>by depending on him. 4. As an Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, by an inſeparable love to him. 5. And laſtly, as a Lord, by obedience to him.</p>
               <p n="50">50. Deſpair is often ground of hope: when the darkneſs of the night is thickeſt, then the morning begins to dawn.</p>
               <p n="51">51. We may ſafely expect God in his ways of mercy when we are in his ways of obedience.</p>
               <p n="52">52. By truſting any thing more than God, we make it an Idol and a Curſe: It will prove a lying vanity and vexation, bringing that upon us we looked not for.</p>
               <p n="53">53. 'Tis a vain pretence to believe that God will give us Heaven, and yet to leave our ſelves to ſhift in the way.</p>
               <p n="54">54. The way to have any thing taken away, and not bleſt, is to ſet our hearts too much upon it.</p>

               <p n="58">58. Look not ſo much on thoſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which our weak Natures are ſubject unto, as upon God for ſtrength and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in them; mitigation of them, and grace to profit by them.</p>
               <p n="59">59. The time of ſickneſs is the time of purging from the defilements of ſin, which we have gathered in our health; till we come purer out: which ſhould make us the rather willing to obey God and abide his time. Bleſſed is that ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that proves the health of the Soul; we are beſt for the moſt part when we are weakeſt.</p>
               <p n="60">60. In all kind of troubles 'tis not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients that God puts into the Cup, that ſo much afflicts, as the ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents of our diſtempered paſſion mingled with them.</p>
               <p n="61">61. We are not much diſquieted when we put off our Cloths and go to Bed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we truſt Gods ordinary providence

               <p n="62">62. Let us do our own work, and leave God to do his: Diligence and Truſt in him is only ours, the reſt of the burden is his. Let us think of Chriſt as our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and God will think what is for our comfort.</p>
               <p n="63">63. In the worſt times there is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God with his Children. 1. By mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derating the meaſure. 2. The time. 3. In joyning ſome comfort with it. And 4. By ſupportation.</p>
